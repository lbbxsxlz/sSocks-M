sSocks is a package which contains: a socks5 server implements RFC 1928 (SOCKS V5) 
and RFC 1929 (Authentication for SOCKS V5), a reverse socks server and client, 
a netcat like tool, which supports socks5 with authentication 
and a socks5 relay (run a server and send to a another socks5 server).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
	- Configuration file
	- Authentication file
	- Generate a connection log file
	- Daemon mode
	- Server support bind mode
	- Socks4 support (if authentication is enable socks4 is disable)
	- Support choose of interface to bind

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
	- IPV6 support
	- UDP support
	- Stock password with a hash ( md5 or sha256 )
	- GSSAPI auth support ( maybe )
	- Set number of client max ( actually 255 is in client.h MAXCLI var )
	- Add --pid-file option to server 
	- ssocks bind localhost, not all
	- SSL implements out of RFC
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software:
  - nsocks is a netcat like through a socks5 (usefull to test socks server)
  - ssocksd is the socks5 server
  - ssocks is a socks5 relay, it run a socks server on your localhost interface,
 and relay all data to the server specified in parameter (works but under dev)
  - rssocks is a reverse socks5 server ( POC under dev )
  - rcsocks is a reverse socks5 client ( POC under dev )

File:
  - /etc/ssocksd.conf is server configuration file
  - /etc/ssocksd.auth is password file
  - /var/log/ssocksd.log is default log (specified in configuration file)

More information see man page:
ssocksd (1), nsocks (1), ssocks (1), ssocksd.auth (5), ssocksd.conf (5)
rssocks (1), rcsocks (1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ubuntu/debian install:
	dpkg -i ssocks_0.0.*-*_i386.deb

Warning: This package install the server with init script and start it
with no authentication in the config file, so everybody can connect on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gentoo install:
I've a ebuild with init script contact me if you want it

------------------------------------------------------------------------
From source:
	./configure && make

Warning: don't content init script

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning, if you import from git, you need to do:
 $ ./bootstrap.sh
 
PS for me: To avoid to wait when you debug the server and some 
socket don't close properly
 # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle
 
 To compile with dynamic lib
 $ ./configure --disble-static
 
 To enable SSL
 $ ./configure with-ssl
 
 Just for remember (this by default actually)
 $ ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
 
PS: for test and debug authentication
 $ curl -U admin:abcde --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 www.perdu.com
